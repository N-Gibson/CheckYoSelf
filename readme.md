# Check Yo' Self

## Learning goals

- Demonstrate the understanding of JSON and local storage. 
- Iterate through arrays and datasets to manipulate the DOM and data accordingly. 
- Demonstrate clean and dry JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
- Match and create a great UI and UX.

## Creation Process

- This project went relatively smoothly. There were four phases of functionality and I was successfully able to complete all pieces of phase three. Iterating through various arrays within objects created from a class. Adding and removing these elements dynamically was a challenge but I was able to overcome them with time and digging through objects (especially the event object). All in all this project went well and I'm pretty happy with the final product.
